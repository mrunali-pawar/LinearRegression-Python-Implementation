Dataset used:
We have 1030 observations on 9 variables. We try to estimate the Complete compressive strength(CRS) using:

Cement - kg in a m3 mixture
Blast Furnace Slag - kg in a m3 mixture
Fly Ash - kg in a m3 mixture
Water - kg in a m3 mixture
Superplasticizer - kg in a m3 mixture
Coarse Aggregate - kg in a m3 mixture
Fine Aggregate - kg in a m3 mixture
Age - Day (1-365)
